Following the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, a reactionary wing of the Chinese Communist Party, led by Premier Li Peng, had rolled back market-oriented reforms, cracked down on private businesses, and poured money into the inefficient state-owned sector. China\u2019s economy slowed dramatically. But in 1992, China\u2019s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, impatient with the conservatives, left Beijing and traveled to the southern city of Shenzhen on Hong Kong\u2019s border to urge a resumption of market-oriented changes. Deng\u2019s \u201csouthern journey\u201d unleashed a new round of capitalist zeal. Hong Kong was the prime beneficiary.

Anyone doing business in China did it this way, circumventing the rules in search of profit.
